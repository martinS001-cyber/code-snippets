#Configure Static IP Address In Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server
$ cat /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml

#Before making any changes in this file, let us backup it.
$ sudo cp /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml.bak
#
$ sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
Now, update the file by adding the IP address, netmask, gateway and DNS server. For the purpose of this guide, I am going to use the following network settings.

    IP address for enp0s3 : 192.168.225.50
    IP address for enp0s8 : 192.168.225.51
    Gateway : 192.168.225.1
    Netmask : 255.255.255.0
    DNS servers : 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.

mind the space between the lines. Don’t use TAB key to align the lines as it will not work in Ubuntu 18.04.Instead, just use SPACEBAR key to make them in a consistent order 

Also, we don’t use a separate line to define netmask (255.255.255.0) in Ubuntu 18.04. For instance, in older Ubuntu versions, we configure IP and netmask like below:
#no
address = 192.168.225.50
netmask = 255.255.255.0
#yes
addresses : [192.168.225.50/24]

#Apply the network configuration using command:
$ sudo netplan apply
#If there are any issues, run the following command to investigate and check what is the problem in the configuration.
sudo netplan --debug apply
#
